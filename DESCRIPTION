Package: NCStats
Version: 0.4.1
Title: Functions to support statistics classes at Northland College.
Description: This package contains functions and simulations to support the
    Introductory Statistics, Biometry, and Fisheries Science courses at
    Northland College in Ashland, WI (http://www.northland.edu/).  I have not
    fully proofed all functions -- they work with the examples that I have
    developed but have not been thoroughly checked for all possibilities.
    Don't use this package for research-grade analyses.

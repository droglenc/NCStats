Title: Functions to Support Statistics Classes at Northland College
Description: Functions and simulations to support the Introductory
    Statistics and Biometry courses at Northland College.  I have not
    fully proofed all functions -- they work with the examples that I have
    developed but have not been thoroughly checked for all possibilities.
    Don't use this package for research-grade analyses.
